The NCOs started day 6 in their PT uniforms and marched down to Sabine Field for Calisthenics and Physical Training. They left Sabine Field and marched to the center field for morning Reveille Formation. After the morning formation they marched back to Sabine Field where they recieved their final drill evaluations for the week. Once they finished their evaluations they marched to Mack Hall where they took the Motivating Others class taught by their Flight Mentor. Once they finished their class at Mack Hall the NCOs marched to the Wise Campus Center for brunch.

After they finished brunch the NCOLS students marched to the barracks to change into their dress blues uniforms and prepared for their uniform inspections and their room inspections. While the NCOLS students were in their blues uniforms they recieved their Board of Reviews (BORs) and they had their pictures taken for the academy yearbook. Once they finished the BORs the NCOLS cadets changed into their PT uniforms to participate in a Team Leadership Project (TLP) and an Impromptu Activity. From the barracks the NCOs marched to Sabine Field to practice the Pass In Review Ceremony.

After their activities the students marched to the center field for Retreat Formation and then the Wise Campus Center for the academy barbeque and clean up thereafter. When the barbeque finished the NCOs marched back to the barracks to pack for when they leave the next day and then had Personal Time and Flight Time before lights out.
