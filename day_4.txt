Next, they showered in the dorm bathrooms and changed into blues for their next class. The NCOLS cadets were taught by the NCOLS Commander and the Flight Mentor how to conduct a uniform inspection. After that class, they changed in-to their ABUs and joined the encampment for a Norwich presentation and a class about NCSAs.
